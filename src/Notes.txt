$$$ Abstraction is the pillar in OOP which we achieve from Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance.

##  Inheritance and Polymorphism
Inheritance :
    Allows  a class to inherit the attributes and methods from its parent class.
    It promotes code reusability

Polymorphism :




## Encapsulation :
    Protection of data

    not giving direct access to the private methods and attributes.


 **** Interfaces


//        Interfaces  don't have their defined behavior. they  don't consist constructors.
//        they cannot implement methods (except default and static methods).
//        Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
