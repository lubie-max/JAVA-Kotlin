Multithreading refers to the ability to execute multiple threads within a Process concurrently.

We have to ways to implement Multithreading : 1 ->  <<Runnable>> interface , 2 -> Thread class

To execute the logic or code , there is run() method for both.

1. run() --> holds  thread executable code.
2. start() --> start the thread.
3. sleep()  --> pauses the execution.
4. join()  -->
